Did you know that the Indian cricket team relies heavily on data analytics to decide their strategy for an upcoming match? Batsmen are told where a bowler typically pitches during the death overs, bowlers are shown various visualizations to help them understand the weak spots of opposition batsmen, and so on.

Honestly, with the unprecedented rise in data generation and collection – sports teams and franchises around the world are tapping into the seemingly infinite trove of data at our fingertips. Sports analytics is a thriving field.

And cricket, as you can imagine, is ripe with data points. It’s a battle between bat and ball played across different formats and different levels. The ball-by-ball analysis of matches can produce some surprising hidden insights, such as batting partnerships and who the best batting partner is (the idea behind network analysis and this article).


# The Role of Statistics in Cricket
Statistics have always had a significant role in sports. As I mentioned above, sports analytics is on the rise and will continue to play a significant role in how teams operate, pick their players, how they play the game, etc.

Cricket is no different. The runs scored by a batsman, the wickets taken by a bowler, or the matches won by a cricket team – these are all examples of the most important numbers in the game of cricket.

This analysis would be based on their individual records. Imagine the amount of fun we can have using this data!

However, there are many crucial insights that are difficult and cumbersome to obtain by using only traditional data analysis techniques. Since cricket is a team game, it involves interaction among the players within a team as well as with those in the opposition team.

It is quite difficult to win matches if individuals focus on their respective performances only. They have to support their fellow players as well, right?

This aspect of the game is quite obvious, especially during batting. There are always going to be two batsmen at the crease. Sp in the next section, we will discuss the importance of batting partnerships in cricket.

# Significance of Batting Partnerships
Who’s your favorite opening batting partnership? I used to love watching Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly open the innings – that left-right hand combination was deadly.
